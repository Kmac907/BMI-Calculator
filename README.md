### [Project Walkthrough](https://kmac907.tech/index.php/2023/09/12/microsoft-azure-bmi-calculator/)

As I gear up for the AZ-104 exam, Azure Active Directory seems to come up quite a bit. So I decided, to build a project it Azure to help automate the onboarding process of new employees onto an enterprise. This includes getting them into Azure AD and assigning any Azure resources they might need. 

This project is the first of four project ideas created by @MadeByGPS related to the AZ-104 exam. Which can be found in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd0YI9ZMHHs)
